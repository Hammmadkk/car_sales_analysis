# 🚗 Car Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Car Sales Data Analysis** project!  
This project uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform a complete visual analysis of car sales across various regions and models. The goal is to uncover sales patterns, pricing insights, and regional performance trends — all with clean, insightful visualizations.

## 📦 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes daily car sales records with the following columns:

- `Date` — Sales date  
- `Region` — Sales region (North, South, East, West)  
- `Car Model` — Type of car sold (SUV, Sedan, Truck, etc.)  
- `Units Sold` — Number of cars sold on that day  
- `Unit Price` — Price per car  
- `Total Sales` — Revenue generated (Units Sold × Unit Price)

## 📈 Visualizations & Analysis

The project uses multiple plot types to explore the dataset:

### ✅ Line Plot
- Visualizes **daily units sold** over time
- Helps detect trends and volume fluctuations

### ✅ Scatter Plot
- Shows relationship between **Units Sold and Total Sales**
- Reveals how high-value cars affect revenue despite low volume

### ✅ Bar Chart
- Compares **total sales across regions**
- Identifies strongest and weakest performing markets

### ✅ Histogram
- Displays the **distribution of car unit prices**
- Shows dominance of mid-range pricing, with some luxury outliers

### ✅ Pie Chart
- Illustrates **market share by car model**
- Highlights the most popular vehicle types

### ✅ Subplots & Customized Dual Axis Plot
- Combines **Units Sold** and **Revenue** for better comparison
- Offers insights into the effectiveness of pricing strategies
